When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use a remote repository when I am working with others on a project and or when I am working on a larger project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might want to always pull changes manually because if they were automatic, then I could end up with code that does not work with my current code.
	

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are like clones, but they clone a repository onto GitHub rather than onto the local machine. Clones copy a remote repository onto a
	local machine. Branches are groups of commits that exist on either a local or remote repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is useful because it can allow you to have remote changes
	and wait until you are ready to merge them with your local code.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would email zip files of a project between collaboraters. This would be much harder than using github because I would have to manually
	compare the differences between files. It would also be annoying to have to download a file every time I am emailed a changed file.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
